LGTM + Alloy Docker Stack

APM endpoints (OTLP):
- OTLP: `http://localhost:4318` (HTTP), `localhost:4317` (gRPC)

This repository provides a ready‑to‑run local LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) with Grafana Alloy replacing Prometheus, the OpenTelemetry Collector, and Promtail. Alloy accepts OTLP, scrapes cAdvisor and Node Exporter and remote‑writes to Mimir, and tails Docker logs to Loki. RED metrics are generated by Tempo’s metrics‑generator and remote‑written to Mimir.

What’s included
- Grafana at http://localhost:6969 (admin/admin)
- Tempo (traces): `tempo:3200`; Alloy exports traces to Tempo
- Mimir (metrics store): `mimir:9009`; Alloy remote_writes Prometheus metrics
- Loki (logs): `loki:3100`; Alloy ships Docker logs
- Alloy (ingest/scrape/ship): OTLP gRPC `4317`, OTLP HTTP `4318`
- cAdvisor and Node Exporter for host/container metrics
- Grafana provisioning for datasources and a starter RED dashboard

Run
1) Start: `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`
2) Open Grafana: http://localhost:6969 (user: `admin`, pass: `admin`)
3) Dashboards: the starter dashboard “OTel RED Metrics” is pre‑provisioned.

Send test telemetry
- Traces: point your app’s OTLP exporter at `http://localhost:4318` (HTTP) or `localhost:4317` (gRPC). Alloy receives and forwards to Tempo.
- Metrics: Tempo metrics‑generator produces span‑derived RED metrics and remote‑writes them to Mimir. Alloy also scrapes cAdvisor/Node Exporter and remote‑writes to Mimir.
- Logs: Alloy tails Docker container logs (`/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log`) and ships to Loki.

File map
- `docker-compose.yaml` — service definitions for the whole stack
- `alloy-config.river` — Alloy config replacing Prometheus/Collector/Promtail
- `loki-config.yaml`, `mimir-config.yaml`, `tempo-config.yaml` — storage/runtime config
- `grafana/provisioning/datasources` — prewired datasources (Mimir, Loki, Tempo)
- `grafana/provisioning/dashboards` — dashboard provider
- `grafana/dashboards` — starter dashboards

Notes
- Prometheus service has been removed; use the “Mimir” datasource for PromQL queries. The “Local Prometheus” datasource has been removed from provisioning.
- Tempo <-> Loki linking is enabled; if your logs include a `trace_id`/`traceID` field, Grafana links traces ↔ logs automatically.
